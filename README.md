# Web-Scraper
This algorithm scrapes Best Buy's website using RegEx

## User Guide
Run web-s.py in your terminal
it will output two text files. The first being raw data of each product
The second file, titled "bb_extracted_data.txt" contains a list of products and their prices ordered by manufacturer

## Skills Learned
This project was a quick dive into the world of RegEx.
At the beginning, my experience with RegEx came entirely from one
assignmnet done in my Software Development Methods Course.
So, I decided to try creating an algorithm that could pull data from online websites.
At first my patterns were very simple, almost exclusively consisting of (.*?). 
However, as I tried extracting more complicated data I began to understand and form much more complex RegEx patterns

## Was it successful?
This project was a success. I set out to experiment with RegEx and learn a little bit about web-scraping.
My algorithm, while rudementary and honestly, not very useful, I did learn lots about RegEx. I am excited to see what
programming projects spawn from this foray.
