# Web-Scraper
This algorithm scrapes Best Buy's website using RegEx

## User Guide
Run web-s.py in your terminal<br/>
it will output two text files. The first being raw data of each product<br/>
The second file, titled "bb_extracted_data.txt" contains a list of products and their prices ordered by manufacturer<br/>

## Skills Learned
This project was a quick dive into the world of RegEx.<br/>
At the beginning, my experience with RegEx came entirely from one<br/>
assignmnet done in my Software Development Methods Course.<br/>
So, I decided to try creating an algorithm that could pull data from online websites.<br/>
At first my patterns were very simple, almost exclusively consisting of (.*?). <br/>
However, as I tried extracting more complicated data I began to understand and form much more complex RegEx patterns<br/>

## Was it successful?
This project was a success. I set out to experiment with RegEx and learn a little bit about web-scraping.<br/>
My algorithm, while rudementary and honestly, not very useful, I did learn lots about RegEx. I am excited to see what<br/>
programming projects spawn from this foray.<br/>
